## Scope of the project
The aim of this project is to combine the Census data and Covid 19 data:
- To identify vulnerable people.
    - Old people (>65 years old)
    - People with comorbidity (Asthma, Heart Diseases, etc)
    - People wthout access  to water or bad food conditions

- To identify zones where this vulnerable people are located to focus the health attention on those places and gather UCIs to that place

- To estimate changes on expected life with COVID-19.
- To have a clean and complete dataset with all information about census data and COVID-19 cases in Colombia.

## Exploring data
### Knowing the data
At first the data is displayed in jupyter in order to identify and clarify what a column means, some columns that will not be useful, and to clean the data according to nulls or similar things.

The exploration are found:
- Census data can be found at XXXXXX
- Covid-19 cases can be found at XXXXX




## Other Scenarios
- The data was increased by 100x.
- The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.
- The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.
